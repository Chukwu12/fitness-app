💪 Fitness-App – Medication Aligned Fitness Coaching
📖 Overview

This project is a custom web and mobile application being developed for Medication Aligned Fitness Coaching, a business that provides personalized fitness services designed with medication-awareness at its core.

The app aims to be the “Rolex of medication-aware fitness”, combining professional medical authority with effortless user experience. It’s built to help time-constrained professionals balance their health, medications, and fitness goals.

🎯 Client Vision

From our discovery and planning session, the client’s vision is clear:

Professional & Trustworthy – a premium wellness brand that feels authoritative yet approachable.

Effortless Simplicity – 3 taps or less to everything important.

Personalized Coaching – tracking that adapts to medication timing, personal progress, and lifestyle.

Motivation with Purpose – not just workouts, but a daily flow that improves health, family energy, and long-term results.

Key Differentiator

No other fitness platform is currently providing medication-exercise interaction expertise with this level of personalization.
